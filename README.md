## What is Prodoc?
We’re glad you asked! Prodoc is where design happens. It’s a digital workspace that powers your design teams — all the pieces and the people — so you can get things done.


## Folder Structure

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  firebase.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
    manifest.json
    images/
      icons/
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
    registerServiceWorker.js
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

Then, you will need install the Node modules from npm like this:

### `$ npm intall`

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack won’t see them.

You can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.


## Deploying your app

### `firebase login`

First at all, you should login into your Firebase acount for enjoy the Hosting Service from this plataform. To deploy the app, simply run the following command from your project directory.

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
